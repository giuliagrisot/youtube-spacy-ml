{"text":"While it appears as a particularly pro- vocative move at a time of talk of an internal accommodation with \"moderate\" black nationalists, the regime's decision to confirm, via a statement from the Ministry of Information, that the hangings had been carried out, was in part a con- sequence of the number of convicted men involved and the publicity surround- int the case. It is the first official announcement of its kind since April 1975, when the practice of announcing executions was terminated by the regime on the grounds that hangings were an \"emotive\" issue. The case of the eight men, all former supporters of the Muzorewa ANC (UANC), had been actively taken up by officials of the UANC and raised by Bishop Muzorewa himself as an issue at the Geneva talks in November. Shortly after the men's appeal had been rejected in early Decem- ber, the Bishop, accompanied by senior UANC officials, approached Mr. Charles Waddington, the regime's Solicitor- General, in Geneva and later sent a personal plea for clemency to the Prime"}

In a press statement issued on the evening of 17 January, Bishop Muzorewa stated that \"all possible efforts\" had been made to see Mr. Smith, but no response had been received beyond an assurance that his appeal for mercy would be considered by Mr. Smith's Executive Council. \"To our utter dismay\", the statement continued, \"the thing we heard was the statement today that the eight men had been executed... this amply explains why practically everything the RF Government has done since September 24 contradicts and/or undermines (Smith's) alleged acceptance of the principle of majority rule.\" (RDM 29.11.76; RH 18.1.77)"}

{"text":"In another less publicised admission, reported in the Rhodesia Herald on 5 January, the regime has revealed that during 1976, a total of 64 people had appeals against the death sentence dis- missed, and therefore in most cases have probably already been executed.

(During the whole of the period from UDI in November 1965 up to April 1975, a total of 60 people are known to the British Foreign Office to have been executed in Rhodesia all of them illegally under British and international law).

The guerillas had danced and sang songs before leaving with a supply of food. Father Egli gave a desire to keep out of the war so that the work of the mission could continue normally as one of his reasons for failing to report the guerillas.

Earlier, on being asked whether he had ever considered seeking protection from the security forces, Father Egli said that he \"was a bit biased against the security forces and I had good reason to be.\" Some groups of the security forces in the area were good, but some resorted to cruel beatings of very many people.

The teachers were told that, following a \"Cabinet decision\", they had no prospect whatsoever of a wage rise, because of \"the state of the country's economy\". The Minister also warned the teachers that their 3 month strike period would be treated as unpaid leave and advised them to report for duty when the schools reopened a few days later. If they reapplied for their posts by 19 January, he said, they would receive their full salary for the month and retain their pension benefits.
