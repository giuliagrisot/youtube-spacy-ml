SOUTH AFRICA'S ARMED FORCES 
The South African presence in Angola has thrown into the spotlight the size and character of the regime's army, and also given rise to new legislation enhancing the army's role (see next article). 
South Africa's armed forces (excluding the police, although they play a para- military role in counter-insurgency oper- ations) now total in the region of 265,000 men. The Permanent Force is the pro- fessional core of the South African De- fence Force (SADF) as a whole, and com- prises about 20,000 regulars in all three services. (Estimates of Expenditure on Revenue Account for 1974/75 R.P.2 - 1974 p.47) 
This is augmented at any one time by about 32,000 national servicemen (con- scripts) undergoing training. (FT 21.1.76) The current intake of national servicemen called up in January, numbers over 15,000, and is probably the largest call-up in the country's history. Those affected are white males between the ages of 17 and 25, who serve for a year of which the first three months is basic training. The use of such conscripts in the "Operational Zone" (the official term, which though undefined apparently includes northern Namibia and south-central Angola) has been openly questioned in the South African press. (RDM 3/8.1.76; S. Tel 11.1.76) 
In addition to these there are some 75,000 Kommandos, civilians trained for 12 months on the same lines as infantry- men and organised into local militias, based historically on the fighting organ- isation of the Boers and forming an im- portant adjunct to the police in the 
smaller white towns and rural areas. But the bulk of the white fighting forces, called the Citizen Force, is made up of civilians who have already done national service and who are kept on active reserve for 10 years before being posted to the general reserve in which they serve up to the age of 65. Since the number of these is increasing year by year, and precise official statistics are not available, a reliable estimate cannot be made. But the authoritative Institute for Strategic Studies in London reports that the Citizen Force now totals 138,000. However, Brigadier W.F.K. Thompson, a British ex- pert, describes this number as the active reserve (D. Tel 16.2.76), and it is there- fore possible that if the general reserve figure is added to it the size of the Citizen Force is much greater. Indeed, Brigadier Cyrus Smith, the SADF's director of public relations, was quoted recently as claiming that "practically every second male over the age of 18 is a mem- ber of the Defence Force." (Star 3.1.76) This could be an exaggeration. Calcu- lations based on the 1970 census figures indicate that in that year there were 993,000 white males in the age range 20- 64 inclusive. (South African Statistics 1974 page 1.18) 
One of the consequences of the South African invasion of Angola has been a greatly increased mobilisation of the Citizen Force. Thus whereas Citizen Force members on active reserve are normally required to do one 19-day training session per year, those recently called up (who include 7 Johannesburg- based regiments, several Cape regiments 
and the Natal Mounted Rifles) will have to serve a further 3 months after their 19-day camps. The Minister of Defence, speaking in parliament on 27 January, made it clear that this extension was designed to enable trained Citizen Force units to supplement and replace national servicemen in the Operational Area." No official figures are available but one report (Star 10.1.76) spoke of 'several thousand' citizens, Foremen b being on the move to

Bloemfontein for training before going to the operational area. The same report indi- cated that the 3-month call-ups were ex- pected to continue throughout 1976. (RDM_10/28.1.76; CT 15.1.76; Star 
17.1.76) 
The pro-government Africa Institute in Pretoria describes the Citizen Force as follows (Bulletin No. 2, 1975 p. 52): 
"(It) provides the bulk of the combatant and administrative units which go to make up the fighting formations which would be de- ployed in the field should the Republic have to face an attack from any quarter. To maintain the state of preparedness of the Citizen Force units they adhere to a training cycle which requires them to undergo continuous training for a period of 19 days each year. They can be mobilized for service very quickly and after intensive re-training of short duration can, like the Israeli Army, be committed to fullscale operations in defence of the contry. To help achieve realism in field training a number of Citizen Force units are annually posted to border areas where they act, inter alia, as firm bases for deployed security forces. In this way units become acquainted with actual field conditions which contributes to the develop- ment of esprit de corps and greatly enhances the state of unit and individual training." 
Back in March 1967 the then chief of the army Commandant-General Hiemstra stated that the aim was to be able in about ten years to mobilise 100,000 men for the Citizen Force in a very short time. (CT 16.3.67) In view of that aim it is not clear why, aside from logistical difficulties, little use was made of the Citizen Force in Angola until late January when the tide was already running against the South African-UNITA-FNLA forces - although it is understandable that 
the Permanent Force involvement there has been kept relatively low. (According to Bob Hitchcock, the Rand Daily Mail's military correspondent, only one-tenth of the soldiers serving in the "Operational Area" are Permanent Force members, although they have suffered one-third of all South African casualties. RDM 3.1.76) 
In the same article Hitchcock reported that the vast majority of the troops in the "Operational Area" were conscripted trainees, "youths, mainly in their late teens, doing their compulsory 12 months' military training.... A few among them have signed on for additional periods of service, some 18 months, others two years. In some cases they have been sent to the "Operational Area" after only 3 months of basic military training. On the other hand, there are some trainees in the operational zone who have undergone at least 6 months of rigorous infantry train- ing in such fighting units as the Parachute Battalion." 
Nor is it only infantrymen who have been called up for the "Operational Area." On 22 January SA Air Force headquarters announced that a number of national servicemen who are members of the Air Force Reserve had been called up for 3 months' routine training. The statement added that although some of the service- men would be going to the border to relieve those units already there, no full- scale call-up was being considered. (CT 23. 1.76) 
Possibly for political reasons, the South African government also sent a unit of 190 black troops to the "Operational 
More women are being drawn into SA's armed forces. Here part of a new batch of 41 recruits to the Air Force learn about the rifle. An all-women Air Force commando squadron is also being established. (RDM 13.2.76, BBC 12.2.76) 
WHAT A WHITE SOLDIER EARNS A national serviceman can earn from 9 cents (for a private) to R2.34 (for a sergeant per day, plus an additional daily allowance ('danger money') while on border duty of R4.10 for bachelors or R5.10 for married men. Thus for example an unmarried cor poral would receive approximately R180 a month while in the "Operational Area." 
Citizen Force members and commandos are much better paid: an unmarried private serving on the borders gets around R225 a month and a married lieutenant about R420. Giving these and other details about white soldiers' pay, the Financial Mail (16.1.76) commented: "Military pay is notoriously bad... especially for those who have been out of school or university for some years." Many serving soldiers, how- ever, receive from their employers the difference between their army pay and their normal salaries. 
The previous week the same journal gave wage rates for the main industrial and commercial sectors. In 1975 the average monthly wage in manufacturing was R109 for Africans (R518 for Whites), in retail trade R70 for Africans (R230 for Whites), and in mining and quarrying R71 for Africans (R663 for Whites). (FM 9.1.76) 
Area." Revealing this in parliament, Mr P.W. Botha the Defence Minister said that they had been involved in fighting and suffered casualties, but gave no further details. (He also said that two more 'non- White' units were being trained for border duty.) (RDM 27.1.76) Another report quoted the Minister as saying that the soldiers concerned were members of the "border area authorities" - probably a reference to the "Owambo" tribal govern- ment (of Ovamboland, northern Namibia) which has its own militia see also p. 12 (CT 31.1.76) 
— 
Logistical as well as political problems have doubtless affected the size and com- position of the force deployed in Angola. In this connection it may be noteworthy that work is now approaching completion on a new airport at Upington in the north-west Cape (near the south-east corner of Namibia). Although Upington is remote from any of South Africa's main urban centres it is now the location of an international airport with a 5,620-metre runway, ostensibly designed for South African Airways "to allow international flights to refuel at Upington and proceed non-stop to Europe." A Defence depart ment spokesman denied that the new air- port was designed for military purposes, but added that all airports could be used by the Defence Force if it needed them. Commenting on reports that the extension of the runway by an additional 600 metres had delayed the coming into operation of the airport until February, the Director of Civil Aviation refused to say why his department had requested the extension and demanded to know the names of the officials who had disclosed the news about it. (CT 13.1.76) 
ARMY'S ROLE WIDENED new threat to Africa

From October to late January the bulk of the South African force in Angola was made up of national servicemen. The casualties suffered, the reluctance of the government to disclose what it was doing, and the slowness of the military author- ities in informing relatives about deaths and injuries combined to create a con- siderable amount of alarm and confusion amongst white South Africans. This was not relieved by the New Year news that the vast majority of servicemen in the "Operational Area," many of whom were due to be demobilised on 7 January, were required to serve a further month. (Star 3.1.76) 
Justifying this unprecedented action and the extended call-up of Citizen Force men in parliament on 27 January Defence Minister Botha referred to his extensive powers under the Defence Act, and stated: 
"The majority of personnel deployed in the 'Operational Area' is national servicemen. The normal service of some of them expired on January 7, 1976. 
Due to considerations of time and distance and the immediate non-availability of other trained personnel, it was impossible to relieve all national servicemen before that data, and it was likewise impractical and undesirable to withdraw them before they could be replaced by trained troops. 
In these circumstances I deemed it necessary in the interests of the SA Defence Force and in the public interest to extend the service liability of the national servicemen concerned from January 7 to February 6.... 
It was also necessary, to accomplish the further relief, withdrawal or replacement of national servicemen by trained Citizen Force units and regiments in the operational area, to call up members of some Citizen Force units and regiments for their annual training camps of 19 days, which call-up commenced in January 1976. 
To accomplish this plan of deployment, the period of 19 days is totally insufficient, and it has become essential to extend their national service to 12 weeks after expiration of their 19 days periods of national service. 
This extension will once again give con- tinuity to the relieving and replacement of troops in the operational area.” (RDM 28.1.76) 
In a situation where some parents and wives learned for the first time that their sons/husbands were in Angola only when informed of their death or capture, this statement did little to allay fear. Public opinion among whites was further shocked by the publication of photographs show- ing raw young trainees captured by the MPLA forces and displayed at the OAU Summit meeting. Thus the question began to be posed whether it was legal for 
the government to send national service- men to Angola, and opposition parties have claimed that it was not, especially in the case of minors sent to the front with- out parental consent. It has been pointed out that the military authorities should have been circumscribed by the section 95 1(a) of the Defence Act No.44 of 1957 which stated: 
"A member of the SA Defence Force may be required in time of war to perform service against an enemy anywhere in South Africa whether within or outside the Republic and may with his written consent be required to perform such ser- vice outside South Africa.” 
Mr Botha claimed that "everyone serv- ing over the border in Angola is doing so on a voluntary basis," and Defence Force spokesmen then 'clarified' this statement by saying that the Minister meant that troops guarding the Ruacana and Qualueque 
water installations inside Angola "were not forced to do so, but volunteered." (RDM 9.1.76) Later, Defence Force spokesmen claimed that soldiers doing active service across the borders had been given a "volunteer form" to sign, but they refused to allow the press to examine these forms. (RDM 24.1.76) 
Apparently to overcome these prob- lems for the future the government has now rushed through parliament an amend- ment to the Defence Act giving the minister power to deploy the South African Defence Force anywhere in the world. Introducing the second reading of the Bill the Defence Minister admitted that doubt existed whether the Defence Act "made sufficient provision to enable the Republic to deploy its forces, to safe- guard its interests, and to protect its borders under all circumstances." (RDM 3.2.76) 
But later, winding up the third reading debate on the Bill, Mr Botha claimed that "legal opinion available to us says what we have done so far has been in accord- ance with existing law. We have not acted unlawfully." 
He denounced opposition suggestions to the contrary as flagrant, dishonest, damaging to the Republic and a crime towards its soldiers. (RDM 10.2.76) 
Two important features of the new law attracted attention. The first was the definition of South Africa's borders for 
military purposes. The initial draft of the Bill defined South Africa for the pur- poses of the Act as "Africa south of the Equator," a definition which would include 11 independent African states, parts of a further four, together with Rhodesia and Namibia. Commenting on this the Mozambican Foreign Minister Mr Joaquim Chissano said that it would enable South African troops to pursue any freedom fighters into any country suspected of harbouring them, and added: "If it means attacking us, we shall face them." (Star 3.1.76; BBC 4.2.76) 
The Progressive-Reform Party, which has 11 MPs, argued that African nations would regard this as a new threat from South Africa, and suggested that the military borders be limited to "areas adjacent to the borders of the Republic." But the Defence Minister said that such decisions (allowing South African troops to cross into other countries if deemed necessary in defence of the country) would be left to military leaders com- manding forces on the border as they were best able to judge on the spur of the moment what action was necessary. (RDM 14.2.76; BBC 7.2.76) 
The United Party (UP), however, went further and proposed that no terri- torial limits be defined, enabling South African forces to be deployed anywhere in the world (and without the need for consent of individual conscripts). This proposal was accepted by the govern- ment and the new law will be couched accordingly. The government also ac- cepted a UP amendment that it be required to report to parliament within 30 days of becoming involved in an armed con- flict in terms of the clause. 
The Bill extends the definition of "service in the defence of the Republic" (for which the Defence Force may at all times be deployed) to include prevention or suppression of any armed conflict out- side the Republic which in the opinion of the State President (i.e. of the govern- ment) is or may be "a threat to the sec- urity of the Republic." (RDM 4/14.2.76) 
In the course of the debate the Defence Minister indicated that South Africa ultimately would have to have a larger standing army. This came barely two weeks after Major-General Neil Webster (Director-General (resources) of the S.A. Defence Force and the top-ranking civilian 
4 
officer in the Citizen Force) had publicly called for the Permanent Force to be more than doubled so as to bring it up from 6% to 15% of the entire Defence Force. Webster said that the only way to do this was to increase pay and pensions. (RDM 21.1.76, 4.2.76; FT 21.1.76) 
The Act now allows all members of the Defence Force, and not simply those expressly designated by the Minister, to be deployed in preventing or suppressing 'terrorism', which is defined as "terroristic activities in the Republic or directed against the Republic or any authority in or inhabitants of the Republic," the Republic being defined as including Namibia. (D. Tel. 29.1.76) 
SOLDIERS INDEMNIFIED 
The other controversial aspect of the 
Bill was the provision which prohibits the institution of any civil or criminal proceedings against the State, the State President, the Defence Minister, a mem- ber of the SA Defence Force, or any other person in the service of the State in respect of any action ordered or taken by them in connection with the sup- presion of terrorism in any operational area. This clause, which appears to be almost as widely cast as recent similar legislation in Rhodesia granting indemnity to government employees (see Focus No. 1 p.7, No.2 p.10), was justified by the Defence Minister by reference to "an incident in the past which caused great uncertainty and anxiety in the minds of soldiers doing duty on the border." He did not elaborate, but went on to say that operational commitments did not allow 
causes 
for soldiers to be withdrawn from their duties to attend judicial inquiries into the deaths 
of through unnatural persons killed in the process of combatting terrorism. Neither was it advisable to sub- ject soldiers to the worry of a possible criminal prosecution of civil process for acts done in good faith and in the ex- ecution of their duties. 
The Bill, which completed its 3rd reading by 9 February, also provides for innocent parties to be compensated for damage suffered in connection with activities relating to the suppression of terrorism. Claimants have to apply to the Minister of Defence, and whether com- pensation is granted or not the Minister has to refer the application to a com- pensation board for consideration and recommendations. (RDM 3/10.2.76) 
CURRENT POLITICAL TRIALS 
MOLOKENG AND 6 OTHERS 
Seven Africans, including one woman, are facing charges under the Terrorism Act. The accused, whose names were listed in Focus No.2 p.9, appeared in the Johannes- burg Magistrates Court on 26 January and were remanded to 1 March, except for Patrick Maisela, who is charged separately and who was due to appear on 27 Feb- ruary. Most of the accused are members of the National Youth Organisation (NAYO). 
The charges relate to the period 1 May 1974 to 30 September 1975. It is alleged that the accused, with other people and organisations, conspired to form under- ground cells "to study and gather infor- mation on certain places like railway stations, bridges, dams, roads, airports, etc. with the intention of later making the information available to other accom- plices and other people unknown to the prosecution for the purposes of sabotage or for bringing about a revolution against the South African government". It is also alleged that the accused studied the economy and obtained information on the role that could be played by the black labour force as a weapon to cripple it. 
Attached to the charge sheet is a list of co-conspirators comprising 44 indi- viduals and seven organisations, (NAYO, the Transvaal Youth Organisation, Natal Youth Organisation, Azanian Liberation Movement, ANC, SASO and Black Peoples Convention). Amongst the alleged co-conspirators are at least 5 who have been detained under the Terrorism Act since last September, (Themba Khubeka, Mphakama Mbete, Nathaniel Mosegomi, Raymond Pilane, and Vusi Sithole) and at least one who has been detained since February 1975 - Mathew Diseko, a poet and former president of NAYO who was 
banned for 5 years in September 1973. Other alleged co-conspirators include: Bokwe Mafuna, a banned former SASO leader now living in Botswana; Elizabeth Kgosana from the Kimberley-Kuruman area, who was detained last August; Danile Landingwe, who in 1974/5 was detained for 361 days in connection with the SASO/BPC trial and eventually released without being charged or called as a witness; Mandla Kuzwayo; Bernice Noxolo; Jairus Kgokong; Glen Masokoana; and Theobald Moatshe. (RDM 27.1.76) TREVOR BLOEM 
Bernard Trevor Bloem, 21, a clerk of Noordgesig Coloured Township, Johannes- burg, who was arrested on 6 February 1975 at Jan Smuts airport on returning from Europe, is charged with contraven- 
ing the Terrorism Act, also with con- travening the Customs and Excise Act and the Indecent Photographic Act, and with escaping from custody on 10 Feb- ruary 1975. Mr Bloem, who is on R500 bail, was originally charged with Eric Molobi (see Focus No.1 p.3) and later with Weizman Hamilton and two others (see Focus No.2 p.9). He pleaded guilty to the charge under the Customs and Excise Act (i.e. of entering the country with two copies of a banned publication, "Sechaba", the organ of the African National Congress, in his possession) and to the charge of escaping from custody, and not guilty to the other charges. 
Bloem is alleged to have conspired with other persons to leave the country in order to make contact abroad with other 
(l. to r.) Weizman Hamilton, Chris Weimers, Trevor Bloem (top) and Johnny Ramrock. All 4 are currently charged under the Terrorism Act. Bloem's case has begun; the other 3 were remanded on bail of R500 each. (RDM 28.1.76)

organisations, to enable them to obtain military training and training in political science and economics, philosophy, urban guerilla warfare, terrorism and subversion. The conspiracy is said to have taken place between June 1974 and February 1975, in South Africa, Botswana and Denmark. Co-conspirators are alleged to be Clarence Hamilton, Weizman Hamilton, Lawrence McGosh, Christopher Weimers, Patrick McGluwa, Johnny Ramrock, Cyril Carter, Saville Carter, and Raymond Burgers. (Of these, Clarence Hamilton was con- victed of two charges under the Sup- pression of Communism Act in October 1974 but escaped to Botswana; and most of the rest have been in detention since February 1975). The organisations they are alleged to have sought contact with were ZANU and ZAPU of Rhodesia, SWAPO, FRELIMO, and the South African ANC and PAC. 
Bloem is further alleged to have con- spired with the others to re-enter the Republic after training, and to organise trade unions or politicize the masses, organise strikes, commit acts of sabotage or, if necessary, to fight the internal forces, with a view to political, economic or social changes. The state alleges that the commission of these acts would have interfered in the maintenance of law and order, crippled or prejudiced industry, and damage or disrupted, the supply of light, power, water, food and other essen- tial services. As part of the alleged con- spiracy, Bloem and the others are said to have arranged with Mr Phineas Pheto and Mr Eric Molobi (see Focus No.2 p.8) for their departure from the Republic. 
Alternatively, the accused is charged under the Terrorism Act with attempting or consenting to undergo training of the sort described, and under the Suppression of Communism Act with furthering there- by the objects of communism. He is also charged under the Indecent & Obscene Photographic Matter Act of 1967 with being in possession of pornographic playing cards. 
An early witress was a Coloured Sec- urity Police lieutenant who claimed to have found in Bloem's luggage at the airport various codes for secret com- munications, two issues of "Sechaba" and the packet of playing cards. Two alleged co-conspirators both refused to give evidence and were imprisoned for 10 days (a procedure which can be repeated indefinitely while the trial is proceeding): (1) Raymond Anthony Burgers, who was arrested shortly after Bloem in February 1975, had been in detention ever since; (2) Patrick McGluwa, also detained for over a year, gave a black power salute to the gallery before enter- ing the box. He explained his refusal: 
"I was subjected to brutality while in detention." He complained a number of 
times but was never helped. "Nobody could help me. I was totally powerless in the cells...... I am a politician and believe in black consciousness. We black people are always bound to white people. It will stay like this if I give evidence in this court against my black fellow man." The case was adjourned. (RDM 17.2.76) See LATE NEWS. 
BLACK CONSCIOUSNESS TRIAL 
The trial of Saths Cooper and 8 other prominent figures in SASO/BPC circles (see Focus No.2 pp.3-5), resumed in February with the defence team applying for the acquittal of five of the nine and the discharge of the other four on all but one of the charges. A summary of the legal arguments and details of the outcome will appear in the next issue of Focus. One of the accused, Pandelani Nefolo- lovodhwe, 28, was convicted of assaulting a policeman by biting his hand. The incident occured on 8 December when the accused refused to enter a police van (see Focus No.2 p.5) because the canvas flaps on the air vents had been lowered, making the interior suffocatingly hot. Carried into the van, the accused was said to have bitten a policeman. He said that he and the other accused were placed in solitary confinement for 28 days after the incident. 
Nefololovodhwe, a former SASO presi- dent, pleaded not guilty and gave a black power salute when asked to take the oath. (RDM 23.1.76) 
VINCENT SELANTO 
Vincent Vuyisile Selanto, 24, of Soweto, originally detained in March 1975, ap- peared in the Johannesburg Magistrates Court on 9 February charged with per- jury. The basis of the charge is that Selanto's testimony under oath in the Molobi case (see Focus No.2 p.8) differed materially from a statement made by the accused to Captain Heystek of the sec- urity police on 20 March 1975. In evi- dence Heystek said that when Selanto made the statement he was in solitary confinement and eager to cooperate. He knew nothing of Selanto's allegation that he had been assaulted by the police. Another security police officer denied knowledge of Selanto's face being held under water in a wash basin. The trial was adjourned to 22 April. (RDM 10.2.76) 
OTHER CASES PROCEEDING 
* 
The trial of GLEN MOSS and four white student leaders which started in December (see Focus No.2 p.9) resumed again on 2 February. Apparently the prosecution was not yet able to furnish the indictment, so the case was post- poned until 1 April without evidence being led. (RDM 3.2.76) 
* 
PRISON DIET ACCORDING TO RACE 
Prison diet scales in South Africa are graded according to race the best for Whites, the worst for Africans, with Colour- eds and Asians forming an intermediate category. Whereas Whites get a variety of carbohydrates (bread twice every day, plus 500 g. of mealie meal (from maize) and 200 g. of oats every week), Africans get only maize in its various forms, bread once a day three times a week and no oats. The allocation of coffee for Whites, Coloureds and Asians is double that for Africans. But Coloureds and Asians, like Africans, get no cheese, eggs or fruit. Africans receive no milk, jam or syrup, and are expected to derive most of their protein from various synthetic soup powders which are served up twice a day. White males get 170 g: of meat five times a week; Africans get 125g. of meat three times a week. (Debates 13.6.75) 
PETRUS MAGASE NCHABALENG, 47, appeared in the Pretoria Regional Court in January charged under the Suppression of Communism Act with breaking his banning order. In May 1963 Nchabaleng was detained under the 90-day law. In March 1964 he was sentenced along with five others to 3 years' imprisonment (of which 21⁄2 years were sus- pended) for membership of a banned organ- isation, the ANC. In September of the same year he was again convicted, this time for 8 years (which he served on Robben Island) for activities connected with Unkhonto we Sizwe and sabotage. On his release he was banned and restricted to the Sekhukhuneland district of the Eastern Transvaal. 
According to the Rand Daily Mail (29.1.76), Nchabaleng, whose ban expired on 17 December, applied for an adjournment to April. He had only arrived in Pretoria to consult his lawyer the day before the case started. He told the court that he was unemployed and receiving a monthly income of R19, which had made him unable to afford the transport to consult his lawyer in time. 
* 
BREYTEN BREYTENBACH, the poet who was sentenced to 9 years imprisonment last November (see FOCUS no.2 p.7) applied for leave to appeal against the sentence. The appli- cation was refused by the Judge President of the Transvaal, after it had been opposed by the Attorney General for the Transvaal, Dr Percy Yutar, who at the time of the trial supported a defence plea for the minimum sentence under the Terrorism Act (5 years) to be imposed. Breytenbach will now petition the Chief Justice for leave to appeal. (RDM 26.1.76) 
LATE NEWS: Raymond Burgers, 23, and Patrick McGluwa, 23, were again called to give evidence against Bloem on 20 February, and again refused. This time they were represented by defence counsel Mr E. Wentzel who explained that considerations of black solidarity made them unable to give evidence against the accused, and asked the court to take into account that they had already been in detention for 12 months. But the judge called them obstructionists and sentenced them both to 1 year's imprisonment. (RDM 21.2.76)

APARTHEID'S 
POLITICAL WIDOWS 
Mrs Winnie Mandela knows well what it is to be both a political widow and a political prisoner. Her husband, ANC leader Nelson Mandela, has been in gaol since 1962. She herself was arrested in 1958 for demonstrating against the pass laws, banned in 1963, forced to leave her job as a social worker, detained under the Terrorism Act in 1969, tried twice and acquitted twice after over 15 months in solitary confinement; placed under partial house arrest; and in 1974/5 served six months imprisonment for breaking her banning order. 
When at last her bans expired in September 1975 and were not renewed, Mrs Mandela, undeterred by her pro- tracted ordeal, immediately seized the opportunity to draw attention to the plight of detainees and other political prisoners. In a recent article she has focussed on the forgotten women whose men are serving sentences for political offences South Africa's many political widows. An extract from her article follows: 
- 
Imprisonment of breadwinners inevitably destroys families, but such destruction is all the more wanton, all the more unjustifiable when it is the lot of the brave and courageous, of those who sacrificed for their people.

White South Africans enjoy today one of the highest standards of living in the world; militarily, the country's defence is at its best, but what is the plight of the political widows, the women left destitute by a system which does not care where or how they will find the next food crumbs for their children. CAROLINE MASHABA's husband was tenced to 15 years imprisonment and he is serving his sentence on Robben Island. Caroline was a domestic servant at the time and is still one today. She has four children. She lives in at her place of employment where she takes care of her employer's children while her own have always been left to fend for themselves. Her eldest child is a cripple. She once tried to institutionalise him but discovered that she could not afford to pay the fees requested by the Cripple Care Association. The other children have become habitual truants from school, but since she 'lives in' as a servant she only gets these truancy reports on Thursdays her single day-off each week, when she reaches. home towards the end of the day by public transport. It is then too late to see the teacher and discuss these problems, and already time to return home. She cannot afford to send the children to a boarding school. She sees her husband once a year in December even though he is now up- graded and can be seen twice a month. 
CHRISTINA BOIKGUTSO lost her husband in the sixties when he was forced to leave the country, to escape imprisonment. She alleges that she was seriously assaulted when the system tried to find out the whereabouts of her husband. She has three children and she was forced to place them in a boarding school from the ages of five since she had to work and could not remain at home to look after them. The Roman Catholic Church assisted her in placing the children in a boarding school. Mrs Boikgutso's problems were seriously aggravated when she was advised that her husband had died in combat on the borders. She was hounded by the location superintendent who demanded her husband's death certificate though he knew 
very well that Mrs Boikgutso could hardly identify her husband's grave. After years of persecution from local authorities Mrs Boikgutso, who is a domestic servant, was thrown out of the house and is today roaming the townships. Her children was subsequently removed by the Roman Catholics and placed in an institution. 
Whenever it is school vacation Mrs Boikgutso gets completely hysterical. She has nowhere to take the children to since she lives on her employer's premises. At one time I placed the eldest child with my parents in the Transkei but we had forgotten that we were not supposed to be ordinary human beings, that we had been forced into separate kraals. She is supposed to be 'Tswana' and I 'Xhosa'. The local authority once more clamped down on her and she was forced to return her child to a Tswana school. 
And what is the position when the men return? Adolescent children meet a complete stranger. Daddy has been a name, a photograph in a frame. They have never seen him and do not know how to relate to him. He in turn is shy and afraid of these strangers, his own children. He walks into a life which his wife has made in his absence. He does not know that life, he cannot identify with it, or play out his traditional masculine role. Too many times, the expectations preciously nurtured on both sides, explode into bitterness, the exploded dream becomes a nightmare, the happy reunion never happens...... 
There are many others: in Natal the Mesdames Ndlovu, Naicker, Nair, Bhengu, Moonsamy. Their anguish would fill columns, women left by their husbands in the prime of their lives, during what should have been the best years of their lives. 
Added to their loneliness, and their physical deprivation are the taunts and insults, the vicious tongue-wagging of neighbours, who have remained insensitive to the search for human dignity, and have thus never appreciated the sacrifice of a husband or son, or who, weak in soul, have readily yielded to the power of the enemy. Wives and mothers stand defenceless.... objects of pity, or spiteful censure. In many instances the tragedies of these women are further compounded when they themselves are banned, restricted, house arrested, endorsed out of the urban area, or pursued by the police from work place to work place, so that every potential employer discards them as they do liabilities. 
What is the future of the children of parents thus condemned? How does one avoid bring- ing up a generation of bitter youth who see a counter nationalism as their only survival 
hope? How does one save such youth from a confrontation with power, from the terrible reprisals that this will bring from a govern- ment so equipped with draconian laws? 
....What future can be offered to one who is part of four hundred years of suffering, four hundred years of striving to invest some grains of dignity, four hundred years in which, survival... has depended on the primitive ideology of saying "yes" and meaning "no", of resisting and serving by not resisting. But all this can only result in accumulating a great anger and bottling up intolerable emotions whose outburst will have frightful consequences. The future is black unless reparations are made now.

THE STORY OF JACKSON BANYINI 
Mr Jackson Banyini, a 64-year old African cobbler turned barber, was ordered by the West Rand Administration Board (WRAB)* to vacate his rented house in Alexandra township, Johannesburg, and move to Soweto. Mr Banyini and his wife Edith, 74, a domestic servant who earns R30 a month, have lived in Alexandra township for 33 years. He refused to move. In 1972 his trading licence for his shoe- repairing business was cancelled, and sub- sequently he was brought to court several times for refusing to move. 
Finally on 5 December 1975 the court sentenced him to three months' imprison. ment without the option of a fine. The following day, while Mrs Banyini was at work and her husband in gaol, WRAB work. men removed the windows and door frames of their house and partly demolished the inside walls, rendering the place uninhabit able. Mrs Banyini and her grandchildren were obliged to move to Soweto to a house pro- vided by the Board. 
After serving four days of his sentence Mr Banyini was released on parole under the control of a white farmer in Boksburg, 25 km. away, and ordered to work for the farmer until the end of his parole on 2 Feb- ruary 1976. The farmer said that the prison authorities instructed him that on account could Mr Banyini be allowed to visit his family until the end of his parole. For the first time in 33 years of marriage, it seemed, Mr and Mrs Banyini would spend Christmas apart. (RDM 10/11/19.12.75)

EIGHT BANS IMPOSED 
SIX LIFTED 
Between the end of September 1975 and the end of February 1976 new banning orders under the Suppression of Com- munism Act were issued against 8 per- sons, old banning orders were renewed or extended on at least a further two per- sons, and six bans were lifted. New bans were imposed on the following (both for periods of 3 years): 
• April Menziwe Mbeo, 28, of Umlazi, Durban was expelled from the University of Fort Hare in 1973, and became an administrator in the Black Allied Workers Union (BAWU) branch office in Durban. Detained in September 1974, he was held without trial for 170 days and released on 24 March 1975. (His ban was issued in the same period as the bans on Mohapi, Carolus etc. (see Focus No. 1 p.5) (GG No. 4910 28.11.75) 
- 
• Phumzile Majeke, 26, SASO local chairman at Fort Hare in 1972/3, and Natal regional secretary of SASO in 1974, was detained on 11 October 1974 under the Terrorism Act and held until 24 March 1975. Banned on 16.10.75. (Ibid.) 
New 2-year bans were imposed upon the following: 
Peter Norman Metshane of Bafokeng, in the Bophuthatswana (W. Transvaal) homeland. In 1965 he was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment for leaving the country for military training. (Ibid.) 
• Don Molteno Matta of Mdantsane, near East London. (Ibid.) 
• Siegfried 'Bill' Bhengu of Nkandla, Natal. A member of the African National Congress, in 1965 he was tried and con- victed under the Sabotage Act in Pieter- maritzburg. He served ten years' im- prisonment, and, like Metshane above, was banned on his release. (Ibid.) 
⚫ Phillip Matthews, 64, of Orlando West, cousin of the late Professor Z.K. Matthews. Formerly regional chairman of the Soweto branch of the African National Congress, he was banned immediately after being released from Robben Island where he served 12 years. (RDM 8.1.76) 
• Caleb Motshabi, formerly of Bloem- fontein, now restricted to Thaba 'Nchu (O.F.S.). In 1963 he was imprisoned under the 90-day law. (CT 7.2.76) 
• Nongameli Mobbs Gquirana, of Port Elizabeth. In the mid-sixties he was twice sentenced to terms of imprisonment for activities connected with a banned organ- isation (the ANC): once at Addo in 1965 for 2 years, and also for 12 years (of which 2 were suspended on appeal). (Ibid.) 
Other developments were: 
• The 5-year banning order on Steve Biko, 29, the first president of SASO and a leading figure in the Black Con- sciousness movement, which was im- posed in 1973, was strengthened in December when he was forbidden to participate in the activities of the Black Community Programme. (RDM 10.12.75) 
• The ban on Rowley Arenstein, a Durban lawyer, was renewed for a further five years. Mr. Arenstein was one of the first persons to be banned under the Sup- pression of Communism Act, in 1952. His bans have been repeatedly renewed, and in recent years he has been under 12-hour and week-end house arrest, and debarred from practising as an attorney. In 1966 he was sentenced to 4 years' imprisonment under the same Act. He now works as a clerk in another attorney's office. (ST 2.11.75; GG No.4910 28.11.75) 
Banning orders were lifted in respect of the following (RDM 24.1.76): 
Students on trial: Glen Moss (I.), Karel Tip, Cedric de Beer (see p.5) 
7 
Mohammed Taufie Bardien, a Cape Town 
taxi driver who had been banned since October 1965. Mr Bardien was recently convicted of breaking his ban by taking passengers outside the magisterial district to which he was restricted. A prominent member of the Coloured People's Congress, he was imprisoned for a brief period in 1965 for a breach of his ban. 
Joseph Mati, of Mdantsane, 
near East London. Sentenced in 1964 to 7 years' imprisonment for sabotage and member- ship of the African National Congress, he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree while in gaol, and is now studying accountancy. He had been banned since his release. 
Halton Cheadle, 27, a former Durban student and member of the Natal University Wages Commission who was involved in organising African trade unions in Natal and was banned in February 1974. He is now a legal clerk. In November 1974 Cheadle was convicted of contravening his banning order by attending a social gathering · a tea party attended by 6 of his friends. He was sen- tenced to 6 months imprisonment, suspended for 3 years. On appeal in April 1975 the sentence was reduced to 30 days, also sus- pended for 3 years. (RDM 25,4.75) 
— 
John Marinus Ferris, an electrician of Worcester, Cape, and member of the Col- oured Peoples Congress, spent three periods in detention under the 90-day law in 1963/4. For various breaches of his banning orders (first imposed in 1964) he served over 3 years' imprisonment on Robben Island. 
Mabel Balfour, of Roodepoort, Transvaal. Secretary of the Transvaal branch of the Food and Canning Workers Union, and an executive member of SACTU, she was first banned in March 1964. 
Clive Keegan, 26, of Cape Town, a former vice-president of NUSAS (See Focus No.1 p.6). In respect of Keegan the Minister of Justice Mr J. Kruger said he had decided to end the ban "because of the fact that for a long period he has strictly adhered to his banning orders, and I have had indications that he has to some extent changed his views." This was the only case in which the Minister gave reasons for lifting a ban. (RDM 17.2.76)

"PROTECTED" VILLAGES rhodesia 
BRING HARDSHIP 
ZIMBABWE 
} 
In December 1975 it was announced that overall responsibility for Rhodesia's pro- tected villages was to be progressively transferred from the Ministry of Internal Affairs to the Ministry of Defence. A new unit, the Guard Force, is now being set up as an autonomous part of the Defence Forces to take over the control and administration of protected villages and keeps. It is due to go into operation on 1 July 1976. As far as the African resi- dents of the "operational areas" are con- cerned, the move probably has little signi- ficance, but it does emphasise the essen- tially military, anti-civilian nature of the Smith regime's massive programme of population removal. 
Approximately half a million people in Rhodesia's Tribal Trust Lands (TTLs) i.e. African reserves, have now been moved into protected villages, or "keeps", and consolidated villages in the north-eastern part of the country. Consolidated villages are designed as a second line of defence in areas less subject to guerilla incursions, 
PROHIBITED IMMIGRANTS 
Mr and Mrs Jack Grant, a missionary couple in their late 60's, have been declared prohibited immigrants by the Smith regime. They were told in mid-February that they had two weeks in which to leave Rhodesia, Jack Grant, who was born in Trinidad, first went to Rhodesia as a school-teacher in 1931. From 1949-56 he was Principal of Adams College, Natal. He was the founder chairman of Christian Care, a leading charitable organisation in Rhodesia which provides for the families of political prisoners and detainees and undertakes relief work in the Tribal Trust Lands. Jack Grant was also field secretary of the United Church of Christ in Rhodesia from 1968 to 1972 and is the author of the Minority Rights Group pamphlet: The Africans' Predicament in Rhodesia (MRG Report No.8, January 1972) (RDM 18.2.76) 
Two weeks previously, a Swiss couple, Dr Carl Stiehle (55) and his wife Alida (19) were also declared prohibited immigrants by the regime. They had been trying for more than a year to obtain permanent residence permits for Rhodesia, having entered the country from South Africa in 1975. Mrs Stiehle is Coloured and comes from Port Elizabeth in South Africa. She took on Swiss nationality when she married Dr Stiehle. On 13 February, his appeal against their prohibited immigrant notice was dismissed by the Salisbury Magistrates Court. (RH 28.1.76, 14.2.76)

and are not fenced. The regime claims that the moves are made voluntarily, after many weeks and even months of discussion between the Defence Forces and kraal heads. 
― 
The official purpose of the protected villages is to shield villagers from "terror- ist attacks" — and coincidentally to cut the guerillas off from sources of support within the local population and a num- ber have allegedly been set up at the specific request of headmen and elders. In practice some villagers are known to have been moved as a disciplinary measure for supposedly assisting guerillas, or other offences. What is certain is that the pro- tected villages are bitterly resented as a humiliating and unpleasant form of im- prisonment in which traditional norms of privacy, hygiene and hospitality are forcibly broken down. 
Once "behind the wire", the villagers are, in the main, expected to fend for themselves. A certain amount of assistance has been forthcoming from the regime with large scale construction works such as water reservoirs, but, in the words of a European District Commissioner, the security forces "are definitely not here to give them everything. We provide advice and materials for certain projects, but the people provide the labour". In Fort Mopane, for example, a 6 km by 12 km protected area in the Zambezi valley, 70 km north of Mount Darwin, bridge building, irrigation and drainage systems, the installation of protective fencing and the installation of latrines have been undertaken by the people at the direction of the military. Supervised by soliders of the Rhodesian African Rifles armed with loudhailers, the villagers have been set to work on a communal basis, ploughing the land and planting crops, a project which, it is claimed, reflects traditional work- sharing practices, but is in reality forced labour.

- 
During set hours of the day, the people are allowed out of most - but not all protected villages to cultivate the land. In many cases they have nothing to plough with, their cattle having been confiscated as a form of collective punishment or sold on the orders of the District Commissioner to purchase food for the first weeks of life behind the wire. Inside the fence itself, families are provided with small plots of land on which they are expected to construct their own huts and plant gardens, and, so the theory goes, breed pigs, poultry and rabbits. In practice, 
these so-called "development" projects are confined to a minority of showcase villages; in others, the people are still living in the grass and cardboard shelters hastily constructed when they first arrived, and without water supplies or sanitation.

A typical protected village in Madziwa TTL, near Mount Darwin, "Keep Nine", encloses 1,300 people on 65 acres of land. They are housed in 13 kraals within an inner security fence, which is in turn surrounded by a 2 km perimeter fence, floodlit at night and patrolled for security purposes. Next to each hut is a small bunker in the event of mortar attacks by guerillas. The Guard Force in this case two White District Officers and a unit of African District Assistants 
are housed in a brick barracks within an earth and sandbagged "fort", surmounted by a look- out tower, at the centre of the village - so that the people they are allegedly "protecting" are between them and the "enemy". Men of the Guard Force are armed and maintain a state of continuous alert. With the added protection of the Indemnity and Compensation Act, their power over the lives of the people under their control is complete and undisputed. 
Since September 1975, staffing short- ages have been considerably eased by new conscription requirements. All European, Asian and Coloured men between the ages of 30 and 38 are now liable for a 56- day call-up which can be served in the protected villages. 
Towards the end of last year consider- able energy was expended by the regime, through the press and otherwise, in con- vincing the public at large of the success of the protected village strategy. In December a group of more than 20 Rhodesian and foreign journalists were taken on a tour of Fort Mopane, which was described as "an ambitious com- munity development project aimed at winning the hearts and minds of the local African population". A series of enthusi astic articles on this and other villages appeared in the main daily paper, the Rhodesia Herald. Since the New Year however, the Rhodesian African Rifles have been withdrawn from the Fort Mopane project and, with a renewed upsurge of guerilla activity and an in- creasing security clampdown throughout the eastern border zone, the flow of reports has been brought to an abrupt halt. (SM 11.1.76; BBC 4.12.75, 18.12.75; RH 12.8.75, 24.10.75, 5/17.12.75)

WHERE IS EDSON SITHOLE? 
It is now nearly five months since Dr Edson Sithole, a leading African barrister and the Publicity Secretary of the Muzorewa wing of the ANC, and his teenage secretary, Miriam Mhlanga, mys- teriously disappeared. Since 15 October last year, when the two were seen being hustled into a van outside the Ambassador Hotel in Salisbury, many rumours have circulated - notably concerning the in- volvement of the regime itself through its special security agents - but no definite news has emerged as to their whereabouts. 
On 5 February, application was made in the Salisbury High Court by members of the Sithole and Mhlanga families for an order de homine exhibendo libero the Roman-Dutch equivalent to a writ of habeas corpus - against the Minister of Law and Order, Hilary Squires, and the Defence Minister, Pieter van der Byl. The move followed intensive investigation by a private detective, Mr John Taylor, a former Rhodesian CID officer, who had been hired by the Sithole family. He claimed during his searches to have un- covered positive evidence of the involve- ment of the Rhodesian Special Branch in Dr Sithole's kidnapping. 
A writ of habeas corpus would have required the Ministers concerned either to produce Sithole and Mhlanga by a specific date, or to show evidence why they could not do so. In the event, the inability of the petitioners to produce a vital witness - Army Corporal Amos Muradzika - brought the proceedings to a speedy close, with no date fixed for a further hearing. During the 13-minute High Court session, the Solicitor General, Mr Charles Waddington, who appeared on behalf of the two Ministers concerned, stated that even in the "unlikely event" of a writ of 
HILARY SQUIRES A PROFILE 
On 30 January this year, Hilary Squires, 43 years old and the MP for Salisbury Central, was sworn in as Rhodesia's new Minister of Justice, Law and Order. Compared with the unforeseen move of his predecessor, the uncompromising Mr Lardner-Burke, to the Commerce and Industry portfolio, Squires' appointment was a predictable one. In June 1975 he had paid a low profile visit to Zambia as part of a team of six Rhodesian Front MPs led by the then Minister of Information, Immigration and Tourism, Wickus de Kock. As an element in the detente offensive, the visit amounted to the first direct contact between Kenneth Kaunda and a Rhodesian Minister since 
The members of the Rhodesian delegation, Zambia's independence in December 1963. 
habeas corpus ever being issued, the respondents would still be unable to pro- duce the missing persons because "they don't know where either of them are". "At no time", he said, "has any law en- forcement agency of the State in Rhodesia had anything to do with his disappear- ance." 
Army Corporal Muradzika, a deserter from the Rhodesian African Rifles, was at that time in Malawi "for his own safety". Tracked down by Mr Taylor, he is reported to have signed an affidavit saying that he saw Dr Sithole at Inkomo Barracks outside Salisbury, four or five days after the latter's disappearance. 
Inkomo Barracks is the headquarters of the para-military Selous Scouts, a special security unit which, like Special Branch of the Rhodesian Police, comes under the direct control of the Prime Minister's office. The Selous Scouts, who took on their present form in February 1973, are officially described as "track- ers". The unit, numbering over 200 men, contains both Africans and Europeans who undergo a rigorous training in para- chuting, physical fitness and survival techniques. They are said to include a number of former members of the. DGS, a vigilante force that operated in Mozam- bique under Portuguese colonialism and which established a reputation for extreme ruthlessness and brutality. The Selous Scouts themselves - along with Special Branch II are believed to be responsible for some of the more vicious aspects of the Smith regime's counter-insurgency operations. It is probable, for example, that at least some of the "atrocities" allegedly committed by nationalist guerillas can be traced back to them. In particular they are believed to pose as 
all under the age of 45 and in no case in- volved directly in UDI, were subsequently tipped for quick promotion in the Smith cabinet. 
Hilary Squires brings a lawyer's train- ing to the Law and Order Ministry. Born in South Africa, he completed his early schooling in Bulawayo and returned to Rhodesia for good in 1956. Following three years in the Department of Justice he went into private practice. He is an advocate of the High Court of Rhodesia and of the Supreme Court of South Africa, has been Senior Counsel since May 1974 and is Chairman of the Bar Council. Squires joined the Rhodesian Front in 1970, and in September last year, at the time of the party's annual congress, was reported to be among a number of hardline Rhodesian Front MPs supporting the idea of "con- federation" as a solution to Rhodesia's 
guerillas from the liberation movement in order to "test out" the loyalty to the regime of African villages in the eastern border zone. 
According to Africa (Feb. 1976), 
"Among the duties of both Special Branch II and the Scouts are secret incursions into Botswana and Zambia to keep a watch on the liberation movements and other exiles; surveillance on the internal enemies of the regime; and gen- erally keeping a brief on the activities of freedom fighters inside the country. In October 1974, for example, they were, according to informed sources, directly responsible for the kidnapping of Ethan Dube from Francistown, Botswana.” 
Mr Dube, a prominent figure in ZAPU, has not been officially heard of since, but it is believed he is in detention at Bindura, and it is likely he has been tortured to extract information. The silence of the authorities about both Dube and Sithole can only give rise to the gravest fears about their welfare. 
It is said that Dr Edson Sithole is now being moved every few days between different Selous Scout and Special Branch camps in Rhodesia, with a view to keeping one step ahead of any legal proceedings. (RH 6.2.76; 14.2.76; Obs 18.1.76) 
constitutional crisis. The plan, modelled on South Africa's Bantustans, envisages one white state and two black, tribally- defined "homelands". 
Interviewed shortly after his appoint- ment, Squires spoke forcefully in favour of retaining the detention system: 
"I don't see how any government can manage without it"... "The sad fact of the matter is that our legal processes are just unequal to the strains the situation of African nationalist politics thrust them into". He "question (ed) whether it was really necessary to make it a punishable offence for someone to go to prison for contravening a number of 
prevailing statutory offences". At the present time, between 800 and 1,000 Africans are being held without charge or trial in Rhodesian prisons. (T 25.6.75; RDM 19.9.75; SM 1.2.76)

LAW & ORDER ACT TRIALS 
Political trials of captured guerilla fighters and other Africans under Rhodesia's Law and Order (Maintenance) Act have started up again after a New Year full. 
On 6 February three men estimated to be aged 18, 19 and 22 were given the death sentence in the Salisbury High Court. KUMBUKAYI PATRICK, KENNETH NYAKUDYA and GOOD KANOKUNDA were convicted of possessing arms of war. They had been captured by Rhodesian Security Forces during an engagement in September 1975. (RH 6.2.76, 7.2.76) 
On 11 February, BERNARD NCUBE was sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment, 2 years of which were conditionally sus- pended for 5 years. He was alleged to have encouraged a BSA Police detective con- stable to go to Zambia for military train- ing. (RH 12.2.76) 
In two trials on 9 February, and again on 12 February, two unnamed men were sentenced to life imprisonment on con- viction of possessing arms of war and other charges under the Law and Order (Maintenance) Act. The accused in the second case a 17 year old - had had both legs amputated after being shot and badly injured by a patrol of South 
African policemen during a battle in January 1975. (BBC 12.2.76; RH 12.2.76, 13.2.76) 
On 12 February, EDWARD ZAM- BUKO (20), was sentenced to 18 years' imprisonment on charges of guerilla activity. He was alleged to have been among a guerilla group who attacked and destroyed a lorry in the operational area in July 1975 and was later involved in an engagement with security forces, during which he was badly injured. (RH 12.1.76, 13.2.76) 
On 25 February BEN GIBSON was sentenced to death in the Salisbury High Court for allegedly identifying three men as "sell-outs". They were later murdered by "terrorists". Gibson was found guilty of murder as an accomplice. (BBC 27.2.76) 
Some political prisoners, assisted by lawyers, have been successful at the appeal stage: 
NEPHAT and SIFELANI MANGENA, who were convicted of undergoing guerilla training, had their 12-year prison sen- tences reduced to 10 years on 3 February, 5 years of each sentence being condition- 
ally suspended. They had been granted leave to appeal in October 1975 (se Focus No.2 p. 11). 
Three students, aged 17 and 18, had their 7-year prison sentences set aside or 6 February on appeal against their con viction for attempting to obtain military training in Mozambique. The students who were not named, were studying for the priesthood at St. Charles Lwanga seminary near Melsetter in the east of Rhodesia, and had allegedly set out on foot for the Mozambique border in November 1975. (RH 7.2.76) 
On 6 February, the Appeal Court in Salisbury ordered the immediate release of an 80-year old kraalhead from Inyanga North TTL, jailed for 10 years for allegedly helping and failing to report guerillas. NYAMUKA SIXPENCE KOD- ZAIMAMBO was described by the judge as "a very frail old man and almost blind", and his imprisonment as "in- human". He had told the magistrate when charges were 'first put to him that he had cooked food for the guerillas who visited his kraal because he was afraid that, if he refused, he would be killed.

A small number of prominent detainees have been released by the Smith regime over recent months:- 
CANAAN BANANA, formerly deputy president of the African National Council and the official ANC representative in the United States, was released on 15 January. In May 1975 he was detained on returning from the U.S.A. and later sentenced to three months' imprisonment for leaving Rhodesia illegally. Shortly after his release in January, he announced his decision to rejoin the Muzorewa wing of the ANC and has been appointed its secretary for education. (RDM 7.2.76) 
ARTHUR CHADZINGWA, former organising secretary of the ANC, was released at the end of January to take part with other members of the Nkomo wing of the ANC in the consti- tutional talks. He graduated from the then University College of Rhodesia in 1969 and was detained in February 1973. 
JOHN CHIRISA, former acting secretary of the ANC, was released together with Chad- zingwa. He was detained in July 1973, having previously been imprisoned in 1964 and 1970. (RH 28.1.76) 
GARFIELD TODD, the former Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia who was restricted to his cattle ranch at Shabani in the south of the country in January 1972, was temporarily released by the regime on 6 February. He was permitted to fly to London to spend three weeks with relatives on the understanding that he steered clear of politics and made no comment to the press on the Rhodesian situ- ation. (RH 2.2.76) 
CHARLTON NGCEBETSHA, the first sec- retary-general of the ANC, was released in November 1975. Ngcebetsha, who was born in the Transkei, was first detained in the early 1960s. Following a period of release after the Smith-Home agreement of November 1971, he was redetained in February 1973. 
Four other African detainees were released at the same time as Ngcebetsha: 
VOTE MOYO, former deputy secretary-general of the ANC, was detained with Ngcebetsha at Wha Wha in the Rhodesian midlands. 
NAISON NDLOVO, was acting General Presi- dent of the ANC, and detained in July 1973. LAWRENCE NDELA, a national executive council member in the Bulawayo district of the ANC, was detained in July 1973. 
POLLANT MPOPHU was first detained in the 1960s at the Gonakudzingwe detention camp near the Mozambique border, and again in May 1974. He was deputy secretary of the Culture, Arts and Science Committee of the ANC National Executive, and general secretary of the Agricultural and Plantation Workers Union. PATRICK GURUPIRA, who was detained in the mid-60s and held along with Joshua Nkomo at Gonakudzingwe, died tragically last year. He received his release order, but within hours of securing his freedom is reported to have suffered a stroke and died on 6 November on his way to hospital. (RDM 14.11.75) 
There is, however, no sign of the vast majority of detainees being released, and it is possible that their number is again growing now that security operations in the north-east and east have been greatly intensified. 
STUDENTS STILL DETAINED 
Six students from the University of Rhodesia who were detained by the Smith regime last summer are still being refused visits from mem- bers of the University Students' Representative Council. In August 1975 it was reported that five students had been arrested in the curfew area of the Manicaland eastern border, and were being held incommunicado and in confinement in Salisbury. It was alleged by the police that together with a number of other young people, the students were attempting to cross the border into Mozambique. By October the university authorities were still being refused access to the students and had been unable to arrange legal representation for them. The Students' Representative Council are demanding that the six known to be still im- prisoned be either charged and tried, or released. (RH 3.2.76; GN 7.10.75)

S WINDHOEK TRIAL 
d 
AND PROTESTS 
South African police used dogs to disperse a crowd of about 200 demonstrators out- side the Supreme Court in Swakopmund, when the trial of six SWAPO supporters under the Terrorism Act resumed under strict security on 16 February. 
AARON MUCHIMBA (SWAPO National Treasurer and Organising Secretary), ANDREAS NANGOLO, HENDRIK SHIKONGO, RAUNA NAMBINGA, NAIMI NOMBOWA and ANNA NGAI- HONDJWA are all charged with taking part in "terrorist activities aimed at over- throwing the lawful administration of South West Africa" (see Focus No.2). The six accused who have already been held in prison, incommunicado and in solitary confinement, since August 1975 will probably have to endure a protracted trial. They face a minimum sentence of 5 years' imprisonment, and a maximum of death. 
During the morning of the trial, a peaceful demonstration gathered outside the court, singing SWAPO songs and shouting "SWAPO" and "Free Namibia". At lunchtime the police attempted to disperse the demonstrators before the 
MULTI-RACIALISM STOPPED In December 1975 three hotels and five restaurants in Namibia were granted "inter- national status" by the South African authorities and thereby allowed to open their doors to all races. The decision came as part of a series of moves to reduce the level of "petty apartheid" in Windhoek and else- where, in line with similar adjustments in South Africa itself. 
Now, two months later, the experiment at one of the hotels, the Kaiser Krone in Windhoek, has been abruptly terminated by politically-inspired violence on the part of white vigilantes, police and plain-clothes men. The Kaiser Krone made use of its "international" status to introduce multi- racial dances, and quickly became a prime target for threatening and anonymous phone calls. Near the end of the year an attempt was made to burn the building down with a fire-bomb. Then, halfway through January, as guests were beginning to leave at the close of a Saturday night dance, five Afrikaans-speaking whites arrived at the reception desk and began to "terrorise" a Coloured man. Using abusive and threat- ening language, they blocked the exit door and punched the manager when he tried to intervene. The police, when called, merely joined forces with the gang in indiscrimi- nately attacking and beating up both guests and management. 
In the weeks that followed, members of the hotel staff continued to be severely victimised and the Manager, whose children, he claimed, were being ostracised at school and persecuted by both schoolmates and teachers, announced that he would shortly be moving to Cape Town. 
Judge, Mr Justice J.J. Strydom, left the court room. When they refused, police with dogs stormed the crowd and they were scattered in all directions. According to SWAPO, several people were arrested. 
The charges against the six are allegedly connected with the assassination of Filemon Elifas, the Chief Minister of Ovamboland, in August last year, but only those against Hendrik Shikongo bear any obvious relation to the circumstances of the Chief's death. Elifas was killed at a liquor store near Oshakati in northern Namibia, on the evening of 16 August 1975. According to his brother, who sub- mitted evidence on 17 February, Shikongo entered the store, paid for a bottle of whisky for the Chief and chatted to him, shortly before the latter's death. It was alleged that Shikongo's purpose was "to make observations". 
Festus Shanika, businessman and store- owner in Odibo and Oshataki who was arrested and detained in August last year (see Focus No. 1) has also been called as a witness. By the end of the first week of the trial however, no specific evidence against the other five accused had been 
namibia 
reported. (WA 17.2.76, 18.2.76, 20.2.76) 
A South African journalist, Mr Eric Abrahams, who was covering the SWAPO trial for the BBC World Service, has since laid a charge of assault against the police. He alleges that while taking photographs of the breakup of the demonstration outside the courtroom, a policeman jumped on his back. Besides injuring his back, he received a gash on the face. 
Mr Abrahams is the International Co- ordinator of the Southern African News Agency (SANA), a loose association of freelance journalists based in Cape Town. SANA was set up to provide in-depth information on events in Southern Africa for the international press, but has already attracted the attention of the security police. In November 1975 Abrahams had his South African passport confiscated as he was about to leave Cape Town for an extended business trip to Europe, via Namibia. He was stopped by security police at the entrance to the D.F. Malan airport and warned that the withdrawal took immediate effect. He is not now permitted to leave the territories of South Africa and Namibia under any circumstances. 
Eric Abrahams (21) is a member of the Sociology Department at the University of Cape Town. In 1973/74 he was the international co-ordinator of the Amnesty International Campaign for the Abolition of Torture, based in London, (RDM 17.2.76; SANA Press Release 23.11.75) 
Aaron Muchimba, SWAPO's organising secretary, now on trial. 
Meanwhile, the official policy of deseg- regation has been put into reverse. The Kalahari Sands Hotel in Windhoek, which had been serving Africans on an informal basis for eight months with, according to 
the management, "no incidents or trouble whatsoever", was told that this practice must cease until such time as the hotel received an official "international" rating. (CT 3.12.75; WA 19.1.76, 2.2.76, 10.2.76)

BANTUSTAN TROOPS BEING 
TRAINED 
For many weeks now plans have been under way to mobilise permanent tribal regiments under the aegis of the Ovambo and Kavango 'homeland' (Bantustan) authorities. The militarisation of the homelands is a significant development in South Africa's overall strategy for the region of northern Namibia and southern Angola, which since August 1975 has been under the most intensive security. The main occupying force, however, remains the troops of the SA Defence Force. 
• 
The first confirmation that the Ovambo and Kavango tribal authorities possessed forces other than tribal police came at the end of January when the SA Defence Minister disclosed that the black soldiers fighting in the Namibian border zone were "members of the border area authorities." A Defence spokesman had a few days previously indicated that the newly formed Ovambo and Kavango batallions were already taking part in operational duties. (There was even press speculation in October 1975 that the 'English-speaking Africans' reportedly included in the South African-led mercenary column that invaded Angola at that time from Namibia

might have been Ovambos from within Namibia itself). 
The South Africans claim that the tribal armies are being built up at the request of the homeland authorities themselves. In Kavango 82 recruits who began training under SA army instructors last November have now completed their courses and are moving on to weapons instruction. They are housed in a tem- porary base outside the town of Rundu on the Angola border. With continued recruiting the Kavango battalion is ex- pected to have 600 men by 1980. From adjoining Ovamboland, to the west, an initial group of recruits have completed a course of instruction in their own territory and are now undergoing further training in South Africa at Lenz military base 30 km from Johannesburg. They are instructed in Afrikaans and wear exactly the same SA army uniforms as the black recruits from the Transkei and other South African Bantustans who are also trained at Lenz. 
Meanwhile, within the homeland, the possibility of issuing selected Ovambo citizens with firearms to protect them- selves and their families from "terrorist attacks" has been raised at high level. (WA 16.1.76, 26.1.76, 6.2.76, 20.2.76; RH 31.1.76; FT 31.10.75; ST 15.2.76)

DIVIDE & RULE: SOUTH AFRICA'S BANTUSTANS By Barbara Rogers 
South Africa has the only government in the world which is deliberately carving up its own territory into small fragments and launching them on the road to 'independence'. Ten tribal Bantustans are in the making. What sort of 'governments' do they have, and why is the apartheid regime promoting them so rapidly? 
DIVIDE & RULE shows how the Bantustans are a key part of the apartheid policy. Millions of Africans are dumped in these overcrowded rural slums, which together comprise less than 13% of the whole country. Their economic function is to supply cheap black migratory labour for the white-dominated economy. Their political life is manipulated and controlled by a government which is determined to divide South Africa in order to carry on ruling.
